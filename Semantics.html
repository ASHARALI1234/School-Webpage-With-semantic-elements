        generation of Pakistanis well equipped for a shining
        future – strong in their character and conviction, just
        in their morals and persistent in their work.”

        time. With its beginnings in 1980 at the
        Gulshan-e-Iqbal campus, KPS is committed
        to grow from strength to strength.

        Recognised and accredited internationally and highly
        sought after locally. Where you study is just as

        have now entered into their dream job or
